    <h1>Structure of HTML</h1>
    <h2><b>Purpose:</b> To give a brief visual of how HTML is structed</h2>
        <p>HTML has countless amount of options to be able to customize the text</p>
            <li>You can use <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, <s>strikethrough</s> and many others forms of font enhacements.
            <li><a href="https://msn.com">You can also embed links.</a></li>
            <li>HTML also has the ability to use images, audio and video within their site.</li>

        <p>After working briefly with HTML you can begin to understand why it can get a little addicting. Being able to code HTML/check a live feed of the page you are making is rewarding.</p>
                <p> A very important part of HTML and websites in general are search engines like <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>

                <p>HTML also gives you the ability to submit input like your name or a quick message like:
                    <label> Please write your Name &nbsp;</label> 
                    <input type="text" 
                                    
                </p>    
    <p> <strong>This was just a quick demonstration of some of the things i have learned so far. Thank you for viewing!</strong> </p>
